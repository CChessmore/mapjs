###MapJS Description

This piece of code is meant to allow users to create shapes of various types using the Google Maps API. This is part of a collaborative project at FHSU during my undergraduate studies. The final product included the ability to save multiple shapes into a "layer".

These layers could then be overlaid onto a live Google Map via a webapp which would allow for tours, clubs such as the Botany club to document locations and counts of trees, as well as let academic departments more easily display where their buildings for classes were located on campus.

The information would be submitted via an AJAX request in a JSON format and be saved to a MySQL database for reuse later.
